# GoDriveLog v3 chat prompts

Status: workflow guidance  
Applies to: using ChatGPT chats to implement and verify the v3 migration  
References: `MigrationState.md`, `MigrationGuardrails.md`, `ImplementationGuardrails.md`, `DirectoryStructure.md`, `GoStructsConfig.md`, `PerformanceGuardrails.md`

## 1. Purpose

This file contains the reusable prompts for the GoDriveLog v3 migration workflow.

The goal is a simple process:

```text
Implementation chat creates one PR.
Verification chat checks that PR.
Mick merges only after PASS.
The next implementation chat uses the next prompt and updates the MigrationState.md file.
```

## 3. Universal rules for all chats

All implementation and verification chats must:

1. Read `docs/v3/MigrationState.md` first.
2. Read `docs/v3/MigrationGuardrails.md`.
3. Treat repo docs as source of truth.
4. Use the target version and branch prefix from the relevant prompt and migration state.
5. Never rely on previous chat memory.
6. Never merge their own PR.
7. Never expand the v3 schema for current-code convenience.
8. Never add undocumented config aliases.
9. Keep changes coherent, reviewable, and scoped to one migration slice.
10. Say clearly when something is blocked or uncertain.

If `MigrationState.md` and this file disagree about the current position, stop and report the conflict. Do not guess.

## 4. Implementation prompt: v3.0.0 — working-code inventory and seam plan

Use this prompt for the first real migration implementation slice.

```text
You are the implementation chat for GoDriveLog v3.0.0.

Repository: MickMake/GoDriveLog

Target version: v3.0.0
Target stage: working-code inventory and seam plan
Expected branch prefix: v3.0.0
Suggested branch: v3.0.0-working-code-inventory

Read first from latest main:
1. docs/v3/MigrationState.md
2. docs/v3/MigrationGuardrails.md
3. docs/v3/ImplementationGuardrails.md
4. docs/v3/DirectoryStructure.md

Task:
Create a docs-only working-code inventory and seam plan.

Inspect the current repository and map existing code to v3 roles.

Cover at least:
- config loading and config structs
- runtime startup and command flow
- OBD, ELM327, vehicle, endpoint, or adapter code
- sensor polling, state, cache, and status logic
- logging and JSONL writer behaviour
- dashboard, renderer, Fyne, display, and widget code
- asset loading and image handling
- tests that prove behaviour worth preserving

For each area, decide one of:
- reuse
- refactor
- wrap
- replace
- archive

For each decision, explain:
- why
- what v3 role it maps to
- what seam or boundary should protect it
- what must not leak into v3
- what tests should preserve useful behaviour

Do not implement runtime code.
Do not change v3 config schema.
Do not start v3.0.1 work.
Do not delete current code.

Before editing, report:
1. files read
2. branch name
3. exact docs to create or update
4. scope
5. non-goals
6. docs-only justification

Then wait for Mick's approval before editing.

After approval:
1. create the branch from latest main
2. add/update the inventory/seam-plan docs
3. update docs/v3/MigrationState.md if the PR enters review or state changes
4. open a PR to main
5. do not merge
```

## 5. Implementation prompt: v3.0.1 — frozen v3 docs and schema target

```text
You are the implementation chat for GoDriveLog v3.0.1.

Repository: MickMake/GoDriveLog

Target version: v3.0.1
Target stage: frozen v3 docs and schema target
Expected branch prefix: v3.0.1
Suggested branch: v3.0.1-freeze-v3-docs-schema

Read first from latest main:
1. docs/v3/MigrationState.md
2. docs/v3/MigrationGuardrails.md
3. docs/v3/ImplementationGuardrails.md
4. docs/v3/GoStructsConfig.md
5. docs/v3/config.example.yaml
6. docs/v3/config.full.yaml
7. docs/v3/examples/

Task:
Review and tighten the v3 docs so they are a stable implementation target.

Confirm:
- documented root sections are the schema allow-list
- vehicles select logs and dashboards by ID
- sensors and assets are global catalogues
- active examples use the same schema rules
- asset paths are repository-root relative
- implementation blockers are documented before code work begins

Do not implement loader/runtime code.
Do not add new schema features unless a real blocker is found and explained.
Do not preserve old config shapes for convenience.

Before editing, report files read, branch name, scope, non-goals, and expected docs changes. Then wait for Mick's approval.

After approval, open a PR and do not merge.
```

## 6. Implementation prompt: v3.0.2 — strict v3 config load and validation

```text

## 7. Implementation prompt: v3.0.3 — RuntimePlan resolution

```text

Do not let logs or dashboards choose their own vehicle.

Before editing, report files read, branch name, scope, non-goals, expected tests. Then wait for Mick's approval.

## 8. Implementation prompt: v3.0.4 — endpoint abstraction with serial/TCP simulator support

```text

Do not encode errors as numeric values.
Do not hide stale/error/recovery transitions behind coalescing.

Before editing, report files read, branch name, scope, non-goals, expected tests. Then wait for Mick's approval.

```

## 14. Implementation prompt: v3.0.10 — richer dashboard widgets

```text
You are the implementation chat for GoDriveLog v3.0.10.

Repository: MickMake/GoDriveLog

Target version: v3.0.10
Target stage: richer dashboard widgets
Expected branch prefix: v3.0.10
Suggested branch: v3.0.10-richer-dashboard-widgets

Read first from latest main:

```

## 15. Implementation prompt: v3.0.11 — retire or archive replaced current paths

```text
You are the implementation chat for GoDriveLog v3.0.11.

Repository: MickMake/GoDriveLog

Target version: v3.0.11
Target stage: retire or archive replaced current paths
Expected branch prefix: v3.0.11
Suggested branch: v3.0.11-retire-replaced-paths

Read first from latest main:
1. docs/v3/MigrationState.md

- compatibility bridges are removed after consumers move

Do not leave two active ways to configure the same thing.
Do not keep compatibility paths with no owner or removal plan.
Do not let old/current tests preserve obsolete behaviour without review.

Before editing, report files read, branch name, scope, non-goals, expected tests. Then wait for Mick's approval.

After approval, open a PR and do not merge.
```

## 16. Generic verifier prompt — any stage

Use this prompt for every verification chat.

```text
You are the verification chat for GoDriveLog v3.

Repository: MickMake/GoDriveLog

PR to verify: <PR_NUMBER>

Read first from latest main:
1. docs/v3/MigrationState.md
2. docs/v3/ChatPrompts.md
3. docs/v3/MigrationGuardrails.md
4. docs/v3/ImplementationGuardrails.md

Then fetch PR <PR_NUMBER>, including metadata, changed files, and diff.

Determine the target version from:
1. PR branch name
2. MigrationState.md
3. the matching implementation prompt in ChatPrompts.md

If those disagree, report BLOCKED or FAIL. Do not guess.

Verify:
- PR branch starts with the target version
- PR scope matches the matching implementation prompt
- PR does not perform later-stage work without clear justification
- PR follows the seam-based migration rule
- PR preserves useful behaviour where appropriate without preserving old architecture by default
- PR does not expand the v3 schema for current-code convenience
- PR does not add undocumented config aliases
- PR updates MigrationState.md correctly if migration state changes
- tests are suitable, or docs-only justification is valid
- repo remains coherent and reviewable

Return one verdict:
PASS — ready to merge
PASS WITH NOTES — acceptable, but follow-up work should be tracked
FAIL — changes required before merge
BLOCKED — cannot verify due to missing information/tooling

Include:
1. verdict
2. target version
3. PR branch
4. files reviewed
5. checks passed
6. issues found
7. required fixes, if any
8. whether MigrationState.md should advance after merge
9. next target version/action if the PR passes

Do not merge the PR unless Mick explicitly asks.
```

## 17. other notes

If a chat cannot determine which prompt to use, it must stop and ask for the target version. It must not freestyle.
