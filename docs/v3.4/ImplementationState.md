# GoDriveLog v3.4 implementation state

Status: v3.4.12 gauge-aware harness sweep implemented
Current target: none
Current branch: v3.4.12-gauge-aware-harness-sweep

## Purpose

This file records the current implementation state for v3.4. Update it in every v3.4 slice PR.

## Gauge type decision

The gauge type direction is:

```text
numeric    = formatted value rendered through image character slots
radial     = transform gauge: value-to-angle needle/arc movement
odometer   = transform gauge: rolling digit/wheel strip movement
indicator  = image-selection gauge: off/on state
bar        = transform gauge: continuous clip/reveal/fill/movement
segmented  = image-selection gauge: stepped percent-threshold image selection
```

Visual identity belongs to assets. Code should model behaviour only.

Transform gauges currently mean `radial`, `odometer`, and `bar`. They use normalized or formatted values to calculate renderer geometry such as rotation, clipping, reveal bounds, or strip offsets.

Image-selection/composition gauges currently mean `numeric`, `indicator`, and `segmented`. They choose or compose image assets without becoming general geometry-transform systems.

## Non-goals

- No `style` field.
- No `seven_segment` compatibility alias.
- No dot-matrix font/text renderer in this line.
- No merged `bar`/`segmented` supertype.
- No eager loading of all `segmented` percent images.
- No remote image generation, stock-art downloads, or non-reproducible manual PNG editing for the generated example dashboard tail.

## Numeric rename

`seven_segment` has been hard-renamed to `numeric`.

The rename is intentionally a hard rename. This project does not need a compatibility layer for old local gauge YAML. If something breaks, it is cheaper to fix the package than to keep a small museum of aliases.

Active code, examples, package YAML, and validation must use `numeric`. Historical docs and changelog entries may still mention `seven_segment`.

The active numeric renderer keeps the existing formatted-value behaviour: character slots, decimal point handling, digit backgrounds/foregrounds, non-ok suppression, and image asset composition.

## Odometer movement model

`odometer` supports `movement: smooth` by default and `movement: click` as the simple mechanical stepped option.

```text
smooth = continuous strip offset between digit positions
click  = stepped movement that snaps to digit positions
```

Do not expand the first odometer slice into easing, inertia, gear backlash, curved depth, or rear-wheel wraparound.

The v3.4.2 implementation adds a flat strip scene model:

- `type: odometer` package validation is active.
- Package config uses `odometer.wheels`, where each wheel declares a strip asset, window position, window size, optional source alignment offset, and optional role.
- `movement: smooth` keeps fractional strip offsets in scene data.
- `movement: click` snaps strip offsets to digit positions.
- `role: sub_unit` maps a wheel to tenths without adding arbitrary decimal formatting.
- Ebiten renders each wheel as a clipped strip subimage through the normal dashboard scene path.

## Indicator state model

`indicator` uses simple image selection with a required `on` package layer and an optional `off` package layer:

```yaml
layers:
  on: on.png
```

Packages may also define an explicit off image:

```yaml
layers:
  off: off.png
  on: on.png
```

The first truth rule is handled from sensor state: a sensor must be `ok` to render `on`. Boolean typed values use their boolean value; otherwise a non-zero numeric value renders `on`. Off and non-ok states render `off` when the optional layer exists; otherwise they draw no state layer between underlay and overlay layers.

The v3.4.3 implementation adds:

- `type: indicator` package validation.
- Required `layers.on` asset validation with optional `layers.off`.
- Scene support that draws underlay layers, the selected state layer when present, then overlay layers.
- Dashboard `type: gauge` routing for indicator packages through the active Ebiten scene path.

## Bar transform model

`bar` uses `value_map` normalization to reveal a level layer from a fixed rectangle:

```yaml
bar:
  mode: level
  axis: vertical
  origin: bottom
  bounds: [40, 20, 24, 180]
```

The first slice keeps the bar shape deliberately narrow:

- `type: bar` package validation is active.
- `value_map.max` must be greater than `value_map.min`.
- `layers.level` is required.
- `mode`, `axis`, and `origin` are fixed to the first level-reveal configuration.
- `bounds` defines the reveal rectangle within the package artwork using package-space coordinates `[x, y, width, height]`.
- Raw sensor values are normalized through `value_map`; `clamp: true` clamps before normalization, while rendered geometry is always clipped to drawable bounds.
- The scene and Ebiten path clip the level layer from the bottom up as value increases.

Do not add extra bar modes, horizontal fills, or style knobs in this slice.

## Segmented percent model

`segmented` value layers use `{percent}`:

```yaml
layers:
  segments: levels/rpm_{percent:03}.png
```

The renderer discovers files such as:

```text
rpm_000.png
rpm_010.png
rpm_030.png
```

Those files are valid sparse percent thresholds. The renderer selects the highest discovered percent reached by the current normalized value, subject to hysteresis.

Runtime values are normalized and clamped to `0..100`; this is not configurable.

Discovery counts filenames only. Image decoding must stay lazy.

Segmented rules:

- Missing `000` is valid.
- If no `000` image exists, values below the first discovered threshold display no segmented value layer.
- A single threshold file acts as a value-driven overlay: hidden below the threshold, visible at or above it.
- Non-matching files are ignored.
- Files above `100` are ignored with a warning.
- `hysteresis` defaults to `25`.
- `hysteresis` is a percentage of the adjacent threshold gap, not a percentage of the full `0..100` value range.

The v3.4.5 implementation discovers sparse threshold files from the filename pattern, normalizes raw sensor values to percent before selection, keeps the selected image stable through threshold-gap hysteresis, and routes the result through the v3 dashboard runtime without adding a compatibility alias or a generalized transform mode.

## Generated example dashboard tail

v3.4.6 through v3.4.9 extend v3.4 with generated example dashboards after the gauge behaviour slices are complete.

The example tail is documentation/example work, not a new renderer model:

- v3.4.6 establishes the deterministic procedural asset generation framework.
- v3.4.7 adds the ornate timber / master carpenter dashboard.
- v3.4.8 adds the neon-grid / Tron-style dashboard.
- v3.4.9 adds the steam-scrap / steampunk dashboard.

The v3.4.6 implementation adds:

- `go run ./scripts/generate-example-assets -theme framework-smoke` as the deterministic asset-generation entry point;
- a small reusable drawing helper package under `internal/assets/examplegen` using only the Go standard library;
- committed `framework-smoke` assets under `examples/framework-smoke/assets/`;
- a runnable smoke dashboard config at `examples/framework-smoke/dashboard.yaml`;
- harness coverage proving the generated asset path loads through the active dashboard runtime.

The v3.4.7 implementation adds:

- `go run ./scripts/generate-example-assets -theme ornate-timber` as the ornate timber regeneration command;
- committed `ornate-timber` dashboard-local artwork under `examples/ornate-timber/assets/`;
- runnable ornate timber gauge packages with `gauge.yaml` beside the local assets under `examples/ornate-timber/assets/gauges/`;
- a runnable ornate timber dashboard config at `examples/ornate-timber/dashboard.yaml`;
- gauge-package example coverage for `numeric`, `radial`, `odometer`, `indicator`, `bar`, and `segmented` inside one themed dashboard;
- harness coverage proving the ornate timber example loads through the active dashboard runtime without new renderer behaviour.

The v3.4.7.1 cleanup adds:

- self-contained generated example dashboard directories under `examples/<dashboard_name>/`;
- dashboard configs moved from `examples/dashboards/` to `examples/<dashboard_name>/dashboard.yaml`;
- dashboard-local assets moved from `examples/assets/v3.4/` to `examples/<dashboard_name>/assets/`;
- runtime gauge packages moved from `assets/gauges/v3.4/` to `examples/<dashboard_name>/assets/gauges/`;
- a movement manifest at `docs/v3.4/ExampleLayoutMoves.md`.

The v3.4.8 implementation adds:

- `go run ./scripts/generate-example-assets -theme neon-grid` as the neon-grid regeneration command;
- committed `neon-grid` dashboard-local artwork under `examples/neon-grid/assets/`;
- runnable neon-grid gauge packages with `gauge.yaml` beside the local assets under `examples/neon-grid/assets/gauges/`;
- a runnable neon-grid dashboard config at `examples/neon-grid/dashboard.yaml`;
- gauge-package example coverage for `numeric`, `radial`, `odometer`, `indicator`, `bar`, and `segmented` inside one dark retro-tech themed dashboard;
- harness coverage proving the neon-grid example loads through the active dashboard runtime without new renderer behaviour.

The v3.4.9 implementation adds:

- `go run ./scripts/generate-example-assets -theme steam-scrap` as the steam-scrap regeneration command;
- committed `steam-scrap` dashboard-local artwork under `examples/steam-scrap/assets/`;
- runnable steam-scrap gauge packages with `gauge.yaml` beside the local assets under `examples/steam-scrap/assets/gauges/`;
- a runnable steam-scrap dashboard config at `examples/steam-scrap/dashboard.yaml`;
- gauge-package example coverage for `numeric`, `radial`, `odometer`, `indicator`, `bar`, and `segmented` inside one brass, iron, and salvaged-hardware themed dashboard;
- harness coverage proving the steam-scrap example loads through the active dashboard runtime without new renderer behaviour.

Example dashboard rules:

- Use local deterministic scripts and stable seed/config values.
- Do not use remote image generation.
- Do not download stock art.
- Do not hand-edit opaque generated PNGs as the source of truth.
- Treat source asset dimensions as authoritative.
- Use dashboard/widget config `scale` when a rendered display needs to fit a smaller or larger window.
- Generated digit sets may choose their own cell size, but slot-positioned assets within that set must share it.
- Decimal points are overlays on the current or preceding digit cell and do not consume a separate slot.
- Do not infer one digit set's dimensions from another digit set.
- Do not add runtime `style` fields.
- Keep visual identity in generated assets and dashboard/package layout.
- Keep decorative timber, glow, pipes, rivets, wires, screws, and panels as assets, not renderer features.
- Prefer small, reviewable slices over one giant asset PR with a top hat and a boiler whistle.

## Dashboard CLI tail

v3.4.10 through v3.4.12 reshape the existing flat flag dashboard entry points into dashboard-scoped CLI commands.

Target command tree:

```text
GoDriveLog dashboard [--config <config-file>]
GoDriveLog dashboard run [vehicle-id] [--config <config-file>] [--renderer ebiten]
GoDriveLog dashboard harness [vehicle-id] [--config <config-file>] [--pattern sweep] [--interval 50ms] [--duration 60s] [--renderer ebiten]
GoDriveLog dashboard examples --output <directory> [--config <config-file>] [--vehicle <vehicle-id>] [--theme framework-smoke] [--force]
GoDriveLog dashboard validate [config-file]
GoDriveLog dashboard validate [--config <config-file>]
```

CLI remapping state:

- v3.4.10 is command routing work, not replacement backend work.
- `cmd/GoDriveLog/main_ebiten.go` now exposes the active dashboard CLI under `dashboard`.
- `dashboard run` and `dashboard harness` reuse the existing Ebiten runtime and harness paths.
- `dashboard validate` reuses the existing config parser/validator and accepts either positional config or `--config`.
- `dashboard examples` exports a self-contained built-in or explicit source dashboard directory to a caller-provided output root.
- Bare `dashboard` now prints a compact overview of the resolved config path, vehicles, attached dashboards, widget/gauge entries, configured OBD source strings, and OBD PIDs where applicable without dumping raw YAML.
- `dashboard harness --pattern sweep` now derives sensor waveforms from the selected widget/gauge behaviour: `numeric` and `odometer` use the small rollover walk, `indicator` flashes, `bar` pulses at 90 bpm, and `radial`/`segmented` keep the existing range sweep.
- Harness input remains sensor-centric, so sensors shared by mixed widget/gauge families use deterministic precedence instead of per-widget duplicate values: `indicator`, then `bar`, then range-sweep gauges, then numeric/odometer rollover.
- Deterministic config discovery now selects single-vehicle configs or requires explicit vehicle selection when the first valid config is multi-vehicle.
- Relative gauge-package loading now also honors the resolved dashboard config path when discovery selected the config instead of a literal `--config` argument.
- Headless CI must not run `go test ./...` against `cmd/GoDriveLog`; the active Actions validation path is `go test ./internal/... ./scripts/generate-example-assets` plus `go test -c ./cmd/GoDriveLog`, because the Ebiten/GLFW command package imports display-backed code paths.
- Do not create new runtime packages, renderer abstractions, config schemas, validation engines, harness engines, or example-generation systems as part of the CLI tail.

Command routing target:

| New command form | Existing flat flag path or machinery being remapped | Existing code path to reuse |
|---|---|---|
| `GoDriveLog dashboard run [vehicle-id]` | Default run path when `--harness=false`; uses existing `--config`, `--vehicle`, `--renderer`, and current runtime duration handling if preserved. | Existing `runV3EbitenCommand(configPath, vehicleID, duration)` path. |
| `GoDriveLog dashboard harness [vehicle-id]` | Existing `--harness=true` path plus `--config`, `--vehicle`, `--pattern`, `--interval`, `--duration`, and `--renderer`. | Existing `runV3EbitenHarnessCommand(configPath, vehicleID, pattern, interval, duration)` path. |
| `GoDriveLog dashboard validate [config-file]` | Existing config load and validation behaviour, reached through a command instead of flat flags. | Existing config parsing/validation helpers; do not create a replacement validator. |
| `GoDriveLog dashboard validate --config <config-file>` | Existing `--config` file selection plus existing config validation behaviour. | Existing config parsing/validation helpers; do not create a replacement validator. |
| `GoDriveLog dashboard [--config <config-file>]` | Existing config load structures, rendered as a compact overview. | Existing config parsing structures; do not invent a new config model. |
| `GoDriveLog dashboard examples --output <directory>` | Existing generated example asset machinery/scripts, plus existing `--config` and `--vehicle` concepts where relevant. | Existing generated-example helpers/scripts; do not build a duplicate generator. |

Flag redistribution:

| Existing flat flag | New command usage |
|---|---|
| `--config` | Used by `dashboard`, `dashboard run`, `dashboard harness`, `dashboard examples`, and `dashboard validate`. |
| `--vehicle` | Becomes positional `[vehicle-id]` for `dashboard run` and `dashboard harness`; remains `--vehicle` for `dashboard examples`. |
| `--renderer` | Used by `dashboard run` and `dashboard harness`. |
| `--duration` | Used by `dashboard harness`; may stay on `dashboard run` if preserving the existing runtime duration behaviour. |
| `--harness` | Replaced by the command name `dashboard harness`. |
| `--pattern` | Used by `dashboard harness`. |
| `--interval` | Used by `dashboard harness`. |
| `--v3` | Removed; the `dashboard` command tree implies the active v3 dashboard path. |

Slice state:

| Version | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| v3.4.10 | dashboard CLI command tree | Remap `run`, `harness`, `examples`, and `validate`; add deterministic config discovery and help-output coverage for implemented commands. |
| v3.4.11 | dashboard overview | Bare `dashboard` now prints a compact config overview using existing config structures and configured vehicle OBD source strings as-is. |
| v3.4.12 | gauge-aware harness sweep | `dashboard harness --pattern sweep` now maps sensor input to gauge behaviour while keeping the existing command tree and non-sweep patterns intact. |

Config discovery state:

- Explicit positional config or `--config` loads exactly that file and bypasses discovery.
- If no config is supplied, search the current working directory, then `/etc/godrivelog` recursively.
- Sort each directory's entries alphabetically before evaluating them.
- Search the current working directory non-recursively.
- Candidate config filenames are `godrivelog.yaml`, `godrivelog.yml`, `dashboard.yaml`, `dashboard.yml`, `config.yaml`, and `config.yml`.
- With no vehicle ID, use the first valid config in search order that defines exactly one vehicle.
- With no vehicle ID, the first valid multi-vehicle config stops discovery and returns a vehicle-required error.
- With a vehicle ID, use the first valid single-vehicle or multi-vehicle config in search order that defines the requested vehicle.
- If no config contains the requested vehicle, return an error listing searched config files and vehicles found in each valid config.
- Do not default to `config.example.yaml`.

Dashboard command decisions:

- All active dashboard CLI functions live under `dashboard`.
- `dashboard preview` is intentionally not part of the current CLI tail.
- `--renderer` is optional and defaults to `ebiten`.
- `ebiten` remains the only active renderer.
- Do not add compatibility or migration behaviour for any earlier flat flag shape.
- `dashboard examples --output <directory>` treats `<directory>` as the generated dashboard root, creates it when missing, writes `dashboard.yaml` and `assets/` directly inside it, and does not add a theme subdirectory.
- Generated example output paths must be relative to the output directory so each dashboard is self-contained and movable.
- If the examples output directory exists and is non-empty, interactive terminals may prompt unless `--force` is supplied; non-interactive use must fail unless `--force` is supplied.

Gauge-aware harness `sweep` target:

| Gauge type | Sweep behaviour |
|---|---|
| `odometer` | Let `n = 0`; increment from `n - 20` to `n + 20` for 5 seconds, then `n + 20` to `n + 30` for 5 seconds. |
| `numeric` | Same as `odometer`. |
| `radial` | Keep the existing sweep style. |
| `indicator` | Flash on/off for 5 seconds with a 1s duty cycle, then flash on/off for 5 seconds with a 250ms duty cycle. |
| `bar` | Heartbeat pulse at 90 bpm. |
| `segmented` | Same input shape as `radial`. |

Because the harness still feeds sensor events rather than widget-local fake values, one shared sensor can only emit one sweep waveform at a time. The active implementation resolves mixed-use sensors by deterministic precedence so radial/segmented RPM examples keep their range sweep while standalone numeric and odometer sources still get the tighter rollover motion.

## Baseline dashboard

The v3.4 baseline remains conceptually based on the reusable baseline config:

```text
examples/baseline-dashboard.yaml
```

The current baseline workload remains useful because it exercises numeric displays and radial RPM through the active Ebiten path.

The generated example dashboard tail should add richer example coverage for the completed gauge types without replacing the baseline dashboard as the simple renderer verification workload.
