# v3.5 Implementation State

Status: v3.5.22 bar peg bounce implemented; planned v3.5 slice list complete except stale odometer backlash claim corrected

## Completion note

- All actually implemented v3.5 slices are complete.
- `v3.5.15 odometer backlash` was previously marked implemented in docs, but a code audit found no `realism.backlash` config key or odometer runtime behaviour on `main`.
- Odometer `backlash` is therefore not supported in v3.5 and is tracked as future implementation material.
- Future gauge-realism work should start a new release plan or an explicit follow-up issue/PR rather than reopening the planned v3.5 slice sequence.
- Stale unresolved review comments on older merged PRs are administrative unless a current code issue is confirmed on `main`.

## Scope

v3.5 is the gauge realism pass.

It adds believable gauge behaviour without changing the v3.4 gauge family model. The intent is to make gauges look more like real mechanisms when values change, while avoiding perpetual ambient effects.

The final v3.5 tail also includes two small radial-only display refinements that need renderer support: an optional needle drop shadow and an optional display-only calibration offset.

## Completion and history notes

- v3.5.8 through v3.5.13 were temporarily deferred so the odometer movement stack could be completed while the implementation context was fresh; the later bar tail was then completed by v3.5.19 through v3.5.22.
- v3.5.10 was intended to cover radial and bar overshoot, but implementation only covered radial behaviour; v3.5.19 adds the missing bar overshoot slice.
- v3.5.15 was planned as odometer backlash, but it is not implemented on `main`; treat it as future work.
- v3.5.16 covers radial display-only hysteresis. Bar hysteresis is split into v3.5.20 so the bar implementation can stay small and inspectable.
- Bar stiction is split into v3.5.21. It may reuse radial transition ideas, but it applies to bar fill/reveal extent, not needle angle.
- Bar `peg_bounce` is split into v3.5.22. The config key remains `realism.peg_bounce`; for bars it means end-stop bounce on the displayed fill/reveal extent.
- Most v3.5 realism options live under the `realism` key.
- `movement` is the exception: it is the single movement knob and should be accepted by any gauge type for now.
- Keep movement config collapsed as a scalar, not a nested object.
- Gauge types that do not yet have concrete movement behaviour may parse `movement` and use their current immediate behaviour until their movement slice defines more.
- Odometers use `odometer.movement` as the single source of truth for odometer wheel movement.
- Odometer `movement` supports `instant`, `linear`, `ease_out`, `bell`, `smooth`, and `click`.
- Odometer `instant` means digit display jumps immediately to the target value with no animation.
- Odometer `linear` means the wheel rolls from old digit position to target digit position at constant speed.
- Odometer `ease_out` means the wheel starts fast, then slows into the target.
- Odometer `bell` means the wheel starts slow, speeds up through the middle, then slows into the target.
- Odometer `smooth` is recognised only, reserved for future enhancement, and should warn then fall back to `instant`.
- Odometer `click` is recognised only, reserved for future stepped-click enhancement, and should warn then fall back to `instant`.
- `realism.movement_policy` is obsolete for odometer movement and must not be used or recommended for odometers.
- Existing top-level `movement` may remain supported for backwards compatibility where already present.
- Unknown movement values must fail configuration loading clearly unless a gauge type explicitly documents a recognised fallback.
- Unknown realism options must fail config loading.
- Known realism options used on unsupported gauge types must fail config loading.
- `realism.order` may optionally control the order of enabled realism behaviours.
- Do not rely on YAML key order to control behaviour order.
- Odometer movement should compose internally as `route -> lead_in -> travel -> settle -> rest`.
- The odometer phase model is internal implementation structure, not the public YAML shape.
- Do not expose `movement.pre`, `movement.primary`, or `movement.post` unless a later docs slice explicitly changes the public config model.
- `docs/v3.5/RealismBehaviourGuide.md` defines the intended visual feel of each realism option.
- Gauge Preview Mode is the simple visual viewer for one gauge at a time.
- Gauge Preview Mode CLI is `godrivelog dashboard preview <file>`.
- `<file>` is mandatory and positional.
- Preview files are normal YAML configs, not a special metadata system.
- Each single-feature preview file should enable one realism feature only.
- Each gauge type may also have one deliberate `99-all-options` preview file.
- Radial needle shadow is a static renderer feature, not dynamic parallax or lighting.
- Radial calibration offset is display-only and must not change input values.
- Hysteresis applies only to radial and bar gauges in v3.5.
- Indicator gauges support `thermal_fade` in v3.5.

## Historical slice workflow

This workflow is kept for audit and rerun reference only. It no longer applies to planned v3.5 work because no unchecked planned slices remain except the corrected, unimplemented odometer backlash candidate.

When replaying the original slice sequence:

1. Read this file.
2. Identify the historical target slice to replay or audit.
3. Read docs/v3.5/ReleasePlan.md.
4. Read the matching prompt in docs/v3.5/prompts/.
5. Make only that slice’s changes.
6. Update this checklist and any relevant docs.
7. Do not implement later slices early.
8. Run the relevant local tests/checks.
9. Commit the completed slice with a clear message.
10. Push the branch to GitHub.
11. Raise a pull request against main.

Then enter the review-fix loop:

12. Wait for codex GitHub review feedback and CI results.
13. If CI fails, review requests changes, or unresolved review comments require code changes:
    * inspect the feedback;
    * make the smallest safe fixes only;
    * do not refactor unrelated code;
    * rerun relevant tests/checks;
    * commit and push the fixes.
14. Repeat the review-fix loop at most 3 times.

Stop when either:

* the PR exists;
* CI/checks are passing;
* there are no requested changes;
* there are no unresolved review comments requiring code changes;
* the PR is green and ready for human merge.

If the review-fix loop reaches 3 attempts, stop and leave a PR comment summarising:

* what was fixed;
* what remains unresolved;
* why it could not be safely completed automatically.

Do not merge the PR.
