# GoDriveLog v3.2 implementation state

Status: v3.2 closed as final supported Fyne dashboard line
Current target: superseded by v3.3 renderer decision
Current branch: v334-housekeeping

## Purpose

This file records the final implementation state for v3.2.

v3.2 is closed. Do not start a separate v3.2.9 implementation branch unless a historical maintenance fix is explicitly required.

## Current direction

v3.2 adds self-contained gauge packages while keeping the existing dashboard and widget model.

A gauge package lives at:

```text
assets/gauges/**/gauge.yaml
```

The directory names under `assets/gauges/` are arbitrary. They do not imply gauge type, renderer type, sensor type, or style semantics.

The only required filename is `gauge.yaml`.

## Architecture summary

```text
dashboard
  widgets[]
    type: gauge
    gauge: assets/gauges/.../<package-dir>
    position: [x, y]
    scale: n

gauge package
  gauge.yaml
  image files
  optional shared image files via relative paths
```

For v3.2:

- the dashboard widget places the gauge;
- the gauge package owns the sensor binding;
- the gauge package owns value mapping and/or formatting;
- the gauge package owns visual layers;
- the gauge package owns layout geometry such as digit positions or pivots;
- `sensor` on a `type: gauge` widget is rejected;
- no widget-level sensor override is planned;
- no code inheritance is planned;
- no cluster layer is planned.

## Renderer checkpoint closure

v3.2.9 was originally planned as a renderer checkpoint and next-direction decision.

That checkpoint was completed by the v3.3 renderer work instead. v3.3 tested the Ebiten path through the real dashboard scene model, promoted Ebiten as the active renderer implementation, and removed Fyne code/dependencies from the active v3.3 branch.

No separate v3.2.9 implementation branch is required.

v3.2.x remains the final supported Fyne dashboard line. Use a v3.2.x tag or branch for supported Fyne dashboard behaviour.

## Seven-segment package direction

The first concrete gauge package type is `seven_segment`.

This lets a complete 2, 3, 4, or 5 digit seven-segment display be packaged with its panel/bezel, glass, digit count, digit positions, format, and sensor binding.

The current example directory for seven-segment gauge packages is `assets/gauges/7Seg/`.

Existing `digit_sets` remain useful as reusable raw glyph artwork. A seven-segment gauge package turns those glyphs into a complete mounted dashboard instrument.

Example dashboard widget:

```yaml
widgets:
  - id: rpm
    type: gauge
    gauge: assets/gauges/7Seg/amber/4_digit_rpm
    position: [780, 40]
    scale: 1.0
```

Example package:

```text
assets/
  gauges/
    7Seg/
      7Seg4Digits.png
      Glass.png
      7SegBack.png
      amber/
        4_digit_rpm/
          gauge.yaml
        7Seg0.png
        7Seg1.png
```

Example `gauge.yaml`:

```yaml
id: amber_4_digit_rpm
type: seven_segment
sensor: rpm
format: "%04.0f"

size:
  width: 398
  height: 150

layers:
  panel: ../../7Seg4Digits.png
  glass: ../../Glass.png

digit_set:
  background: ../../7SegBack.png
  characters:
    "0": ../7Seg0.png
    "1": ../7Seg1.png
  spacing: 4

digits:
  count: 4
  positions:
    - [35, 35]
    - [117, 35]
    - [199, 35]
    - [281, 35]
```

## Radial package direction

Radial gauges are routed through the dashboard scene runtime. Fyne radial rendering uses package-owned normalised `pivot.face` and `pivot.needle` coordinates to align a rotated needle frame to the face pivot.

The v3.2.6 Fyne adapter prepares a deterministic 1-degree needle frame set for each unique needle asset and pivot pair. Live updates then select an already-prepared frame and update the existing keyed `canvas.Image` resource instead of decoding, rotating, PNG-encoding, and creating a new resource during normal sweep updates.

The v3.2 display path uses latest-only scene coalescing without blocking harness or sensor event generation on Fyne rendering. Slow display rendering can reduce visible frame rate, but it must not throttle producer cadence.

Example `gauge.yaml`:

```yaml
id: simple_radial_rpm
type: radial
sensor: rpm

size:
  width: 512
  height: 512

layers:
  background: ../shared/radial/simple_rpm/bezel.png
  face: ../shared/radial/simple_rpm/face.png
  ticks: ../shared/radial/simple_rpm/ticks.png
  needle: ../shared/radial/simple_rpm/needle.png
  overlay: ../shared/radial/simple_rpm/glass.png

pivot:
  face: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }
  needle: { x: 0.5, y: 0.5 }

value_map:
  min: 0
  max: 7000
  start_angle: -135
  end_angle: 135
  clamp: true
```

## v3.2.1 implementation notes

- Added `internal/dashboard/gauges` as the loader package for self-contained gauge packages.
- `LoadPackage` accepts a package directory under `assets/gauges/**` and resolves `gauge.yaml` from that directory.
- The loader parses `seven_segment` and `radial` package types with package-owned fields including `sensor`, `format`, `digit_set`, `digits`, `layers`, `pivot`, and `value_map`.
- Layer and digit image paths resolve relative to the package `gauge.yaml` directory.
- Relative image paths such as `../7Seg0.png` and `../../7Seg4Digits.png` are allowed when the resolved path remains inside the inferred `assets` tree.
- Paths escaping the asset tree are rejected.
- This slice intentionally does not add dashboard widget config, scene model, renderer, Fyne, inheritance, cluster, or example asset behaviour.

## v3.2.2 implementation notes

- Added `type: gauge` to dashboard widget config parsing and validation.
- Gauge widgets use `gauge` for the package directory, `position` for placement, and `scale` for sizing.
- Gauge widgets reject widget-level `sensor` because sensor ownership stays inside the gauge package.
- Gauge widgets also reject widget-level `asset`; existing asset families remain for legacy image, digit, bar, frame, and indicator widgets.
- Gauge paths must be repository-root relative package directories under `assets/gauges/`.
- Removed the duplicate post-`Validate` gauge widget ownership pass after the ownership rule moved into normal widget validation.
- This slice intentionally does not add scene model, renderer, Fyne, package loading from dashboard runtime, inheritance, cluster, or example asset behaviour.

## v3.2.3 implementation notes

- Added a seven-segment scene model for loaded gauge packages.
- Wired dashboard runtime `type: gauge` widgets to load the configured `widget.gauge` package.
- Gauge widgets use the package-owned sensor id to read current sensor state.
- Dashboard scene widgets now carry gauge package identity, package path, scale, status/error, formatted text, static layer parts, digit asset parts, digit positions, and scene-signature data.
- Fyne adapter positioning now honours package-owned part coordinates and widget scale while preserving slot-based positioning for legacy digit widgets.
- Static package layers are included even for non-`ok` sensor states.
- Live digit text, digit backgrounds, character parts, decimal-point parts, and foreground parts are emitted only for `ok` sensor states.
- Scene signatures include package, placement, size, status, text, layer, asset, character, slot, and digit-position data so formatted-output and layout changes are detectable.
- This slice intentionally does not add radial gauge scene model, example assets, inheritance, cluster, or sensor override behaviour.

## v3.2.4 implementation notes

- Hardened the Fyne seven-segment rendering path rather than replacing the existing scene work from v3.2.3.
- Reused Fyne image objects by stable scene/widget/part keys so digit-only resource changes do not rebuild the canvas object tree.
- Kept glass/overlay rendering as an ordered scene part and added coverage that glass remains the last rendered object over live digits.
- Added deterministic speed-quality coverage through `BenchmarkSevenSegmentAdapterUpdate`, which measures repeated seven-segment digit updates with allocations.
- The benchmark is intentionally comparative rather than a hard time threshold because CI and Raspberry Pi hardware vary.

## v3.2.5 implementation notes

- Added radial gauge scene model support for loaded `radial` gauge packages.
- Routed radial gauge packages through dashboard runtime `type: gauge` widgets.
- Dashboard `Widget` scene data now preserves radial face pivot, needle pivot, and calculated angle.
- Dashboard `Part` scene data now preserves radial needle angle, face pivot, and needle pivot for the later renderer.
- Value mapping uses package-owned `value_map` min/max/start/end angles and honours `clamp`.
- Static radial package layers are included even for non-`ok` sensor states.
- Live radial needle parts are emitted only for `ok` sensor states.
- Dashboard scene signatures include radial angle and pivot data so angle and geometry changes are detectable.
- Added runtime coverage for radial gauge widget package loading, angle/pivot preservation, non-ok needle suppression, and angle-based redraw detection.
- This slice intentionally does not add Fyne radial drawing/rotation, example assets, inheritance, cluster, or sensor override behaviour.

## v3.2.6 implementation notes

- Added Fyne adapter support for radial gauge scene parts.
- Static radial layer parts render through the existing ordered dashboard scene part list.
- Needle PNG frames are prepared as deterministic 1-degree rotated frame sets keyed by source asset and normalised needle pivot.
- Normal live radial updates select an already-prepared frame and update the existing keyed `canvas.Image` resource.
- Added non-blocking `LatestSink.SubmitLatest` for display/harness paths so Fyne rendering no longer backpressures the harness or sensor event cadence.
- Display sink stats now expose submitted, rendered, superseded, and render-duration values for diagnostics.
- Needle placement aligns the selected frame pivot with the gauge face pivot using normalised package-owned pivots.
- Existing seven-segment and non-gauge widget rendering paths are preserved.
- Added adapter coverage for radial layer ordering, live needle rendering, omitted non-ok needle behaviour, keyed object reuse, prepared frame-set reuse, and radial needle update benchmarks.
- Added scene-sink coverage for non-blocking latest-only submission, error visibility, render timing stats, and no-backpressure producer benchmarks.
- This slice intentionally does not add gauge package loading changes, dashboard config changes, example gauge packages, sensor overrides, inheritance, clusters, animation, or procedural drawing.

## v3.2.7 implementation notes

- Skipped as a standalone slice because example gauge packages already exist under `docs/v3.2/assets/gauges/`.
- The v3.2.8 baseline reuses the existing speed, RPM, and radial examples instead of creating a separate example-package pass.
- The only added package is a tiny three-digit temperature gauge YAML wrapper over existing green seven-segment artwork so the baseline can verify `-10..40` and minus-symbol rendering.

## v3.2.8 implementation notes

- Added `docs/v3.2/baseline-dashboard.yaml` for the baseline harness workload.
- The baseline uses three selected sensors: `coolant_temperature`, `speed`, and `rpm`.
- The dashboard exercises a three-digit temperature seven-segment gauge, three-digit speed seven-segment gauge, four-digit RPM seven-segment gauge, and radial RPM gauge using the same `rpm` sensor.
- Added `docs/v3.2/BaselineDashboardVerification.md` with fixed, sweep, heartbeat, and non-ok/missing-state verification notes.
- Documented expected summary stats from the existing harness output: `events`, `display_submitted`, `display_rendered`, `display_superseded`, and `display_last_render`.
- Documented that the current CLI harness emits `ok` sensor states only, so non-ok/missing-state verification remains lower-level test coverage rather than a CLI baseline run.
- This slice intentionally does not start Ebiten work and does not change Fyne rendering.

## Pending slices

None. v3.2 is closed except for explicit historical maintenance fixes.

## Deferred v3.1 work

- v3.1.7 dashboard event efficiency is superseded by the v3.2/v3.3 display-sink and renderer work.
- v3.1.8 retirement readiness is superseded by the v3.3 Fyne removal and renderer decision.

## Update rule

Historical note only: v3.2 is closed. Future active dashboard work should start from the v3.3/v3.4 state documents.
