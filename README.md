# GoDriveLog

GoDriveLog is a deliberately small Go/Ebiten in-vehicle telemetry dashboard for Raspberry Pi-style installs.

The project is being reshaped around the active v3 runtime:

```text
vehicle endpoint
-> sensor polling runtime
-> sensor events
-> logs and dashboards as subscribers
-> dashboard scene model
-> renderer adapter
```

Ebiten is the default and only active renderer implementation in the v3.3 branch. The renderer remains a boundary: runtime, sensors, logging, and dashboard scene generation should not become Ebiten-owned.

The goal is simple: read vehicle telemetry, keep the runtime boring, log useful data, and render a dashboard that can look convincingly like real retro hardware instead of a web page wearing driving gloves.

## Current status

GoDriveLog now uses Ebiten for the active v3 dashboard command path. Earlier Fyne dashboard code lives in the v3.2.x line only; v3.3.x and later are Ebiten-first.

The current v3.3 implementation state is documented under `docs/v3.3/`. Some older config/runtime documents may still describe legacy concepts while the repo is being migrated.

## v3 direction

The intended v3 config shape is:

```yaml
vehicles: {}
sensors: {}
assets: {}
logs: {}
dashboards: {}
```

The important design rules are:

- Sensors own polling cadence using `poll`.
- Logs and dashboards subscribe to sensor events.
- Logs do not poll sensors independently.
- Dashboards do not fetch OBD values directly.
- If a documented config item exists, it is active.
- Each dashboard owns its physical/logical display target.
- GoDriveLog connects to an OBD-like endpoint address.
- Bench testing should use an OBD-like endpoint, for example `tcp://127.0.0.1:35000`.
- Unknown config fields should fail validation during v3 implementation.

Boring boundaries are intentional. Cleverness is allowed only when it pays rent and does not bring a YAML demon as a lodger.

## Runtime model

The intended v3 runtime is:

```text
load config
resolve vehicle
connect to the vehicle OBD-like endpoint
start sensor runtime
poll sensors according to sensors.<id>.poll
emit sensor reading/status events
logs receive selected sensor events
dashboards receive sensor events implied by widgets
render dashboard updates from event state
```

Sensor readings should carry their original read timestamp. Log writers may add their own write timestamp, but the sensor timestamp is the source of truth.

Sensor status should distinguish real values from trouble states such as:

```text
ok
stale
error
missing/unsupported
```

Do not use `0` as an error value. Zero is a perfectly respectable number and should not be framed for crimes committed by the transport layer.

## Dashboard asset direction

The v3 dashboard direction is asset-driven and photoreal-friendly.

Common render pattern:

```text
asset background
+ value/state-driven dynamic layer
+ optional foreground/glass/bezel overlay
= rendered widget
```

The active example dashboard uses self-contained gauge packages under `examples/assets/gauges/**/gauge.yaml`. Gauge widgets place packages; gauge packages own their sensor binding, value formatting/mapping, visual layers, and package-local geometry.

For numeric gauge packages that use seven-segment artwork, digit positions are artwork-alignment coordinates. They may look larger than the declared logical package size because the source artwork and the dashboard fit box are not always the same coordinate system. The rendered result and package comments are the authority.

## Documentation

Useful docs live under:

```text
docs/v3.3/
docs/v3.2/
docs/archive/
```

The v3.2 docs describe the final supported Fyne dashboard line. The active v3.3 docs describe the Ebiten-first renderer path and the active renderer boundary.

## Build

From the repository root:

```bash
go mod tidy
go build ./cmd/GoDriveLog
```

The binary will be written to the current directory as `GoDriveLog` unless you pass `-o`.

## Baseline dashboard harness

From the repository root:

```bash
go run ./cmd/GoDriveLog dashboard harness vw_caddy \
  --config ./examples/baseline-dashboard.yaml \
  --pattern sweep \
  --interval 50ms \
  --duration 60s \
  --renderer ebiten
```

`--renderer ebiten` is explicit for readability. Ebiten is already the default renderer in the active v3.4 dashboard command path.

With `--pattern sweep`, the harness is now gauge-aware: numeric and odometer sources walk from `-20` to `+30`, radial and segmented sources keep the full-range sweep, indicator sources flash, and bar sources pulse at 90 bpm.

## Dashboard overview

To inspect the resolved dashboard config without dumping the whole YAML:

```bash
go run ./cmd/GoDriveLog dashboard --config ./examples/baseline-dashboard.yaml
```

The bare `dashboard` command prints a compact overview of vehicles, attached dashboards, widget/gauge sources, and OBD-backed PIDs. It is a map, not the territory, but it is at least the correct map.

## Gauge preview

To inspect one gauge manually without live OBD input or the full harness:

```bash
go run ./cmd/GoDriveLog dashboard preview \
  ./examples/gauge-realism/radial/00-baseline.yaml
```

Useful controls:

- Left/Right jump to min/max.
- Up/Down step the value.
- Shift + Up/Down uses a coarse step.
- Ctrl/Cmd + Up/Down uses a fine step.
- `R` resets to midpoint.
- `Space` replays the last transition.
- `Esc` or `Q` quits.

Baseline preview files live under `examples/gauge-realism/` for `radial`, `numeric`, `odometer`, `bar`, `indicator`, and `segmented`.

## Raspberry Pi notes

The active v3.3 dashboard renderer is Ebiten. Raspberry Pi builds should focus on Go, graphics/display dependencies needed by Ebiten, and the selected kiosk/display setup.

## OBD transport

The intended v3 model is that GoDriveLog connects to an OBD-like endpoint declared by the selected vehicle:

```yaml
vehicles:
  vw_caddy:
    name: "VW Caddy"
    obd:
      address: "serial:///dev/ttyUSB0"
      timeout: 1000
```

For bench or harness work, use `dashboard harness` and the reusable baseline config instead of requiring live OBD hardware.
